<h2 ng-include="'product-description.html'"></h2>

Note for those double and single quotes.

However, to include template, use Custom Directives.
Types of Directives:
  ->Template-Expanding
     -define a custom tag that is expanded
     -include controller logic
  ->Complex UI
     -calling events/event handlers
     -reusing components

HTML
<product-description></product-description>

JS

app.directive("productDescription", function(){ //attention to the '-' which is interpreted by the JS as camel case
  return {
    restrict: 'E',  //for 'Element'
    templateUrl: 'product-description.html'
  };
});

-----
restrict: ('A' - matches attribute name, E' - matches element name, 'C' - matches class name)- more@ https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive

HTML
e.g.: 'A'
HTML
<h2 product-description></h2>

JS

app.directive("productDescription", function(){ //attention to the '-' which is interpreted by the JS as camel case
  return {
    restrict: 'E',  //for 'Element'
    templateUrl: 'product-description.html'
  };
});

-- Moving controller into directive
app.directive("productDescription", function(){ //attention to the '-' which is interpreted by the JS as camel case
  return {
    restrict: 'E',  //for 'Element'
    templateUrl: 'product-description.html',
    controller:function{
      (...)
    },
    controllerAs:"panels"
  };
});
