-- TypeOfs --
boolean, string, number, undefined, object(ex:null),...


-- Prompts and Confirms -- (just for information purposes)

var name = prompt("What is your name?");

if(typeof name == "string){

} // the other way around would be to evaluate if the type of is not a string.
  // An object is what would be returned if the user clicked on "cancel" in the prompt since it would return null, and null's typeof is object


if(confirm ("Are you sure you want to save your name as: "+name)){ //since this returns a boolean value
  // do stuff
}
